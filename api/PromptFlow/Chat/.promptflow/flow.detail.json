                  "Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements \nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as \nmanagement determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s \nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.  \n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the directors and the corporate executive officers\u2019 \nperformance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group\u2019s \nfinancial reporting process.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a \nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report \nthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

                "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

          "output": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

                    "Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements \nin accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan, and for such internal control as \nmanagement determines is necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are \nfree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. \n\nIn preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group\u2019s \nability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern in \naccordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan.  \n\nThe Audit Committee is responsible for overseeing the directors and the corporate executive officers\u2019 \nperformance of their duties with regard to the design, implementation and maintenance of the Group\u2019s \nfinancial reporting process.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\fAuditor\u2019s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements \n\nOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as a \nwhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor\u2019s report \nthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

                  "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.\n\nAmounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

                "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', metadata={'id': '2023_e_fy_pdf-41', 'source': '2023_e_fy.pdf'}), Document(page_content='Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

      "output": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

Investments in affiliates that are not accounted for \nby the equity method are carried at cost using the moving-average method. Other securities are carried at \nfair value (cost of securities sold is calculated using primarily the moving average method). Stocks with no \nmarket prices are carried at cost using the moving-average method.   \n\nNet  unrealized  gains  (losses)  on  other  securities  are  included  in  \u201cNet  assets\u201d  except  for  the  amount \n\nreflected on the gains or losses by applying fair value hedge accounting.   \n\n2) Securities included in money held in trust are carried in the same method as in (1) and (2), 1) above.",

The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.

We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience.

Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

              "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

            "modifiedAnswer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

                  "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.\n\nAmounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \n\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \n\n\uf09e \n\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \ncontrol.  \n\n\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \n\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \n\n\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \ngoing concern.  \n\n\uf09e \n\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \nachieves fair presentation. \n\n\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \n\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \n\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \nidentify during our audit.  \n\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \n\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \n\n \n \n \n\fConvenience Translation \n\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \n\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \n\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \nDesignated Engagement Partner \nCertified Public Accountant \n\nKPMG AZSA LLC \nTokyo Office, Japan \nJune 21, 2023   \n\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.",

              "answer": "At Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group, the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in Japan. The process involves the following steps:\n\n1. Scope of Consolidation: The company determines the entities to be consolidated based on its control over other companies. The consolidated subsidiaries are fully incorporated into the financial statements.\n\n2. Financial Data Collection: Financial data is collected from all subsidiaries and affiliate companies. This includes information on assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and other relevant financial metrics.\n\n3. Accounting Policies: The company establishes accounting policies that are consistently applied across all entities to ensure uniformity and comparability in the consolidated financial statements.\n\n4. Elimination of Intercompany Transactions: Intercompany transactions, such as sales or loans between subsidiaries, are eliminated to avoid double counting and to reflect only the transactions with external parties.\n\n5. Consolidation Adjustments: Adjustments are made to align accounting practices and policies across all subsidiaries. This includes adjustments for consolidated foreign currency translation, fair value adjustments, and other necessary modifications.\n\n6. Financial Statement Presentation: The consolidated financial statements are prepared, including the consolidated balance sheet, income statement, cash flow statement, and statement of changes in equity. These statements provide a comprehensive overview of the financial performance and position of the entire group.\n\n7. Review and Audit: The consolidated financial statements are reviewed by management and audited by external auditors to ensure their accuracy, compliance with accounting standards, and proper disclosure of information.\n\nIt is important to note that these steps are a general overview of the consolidated statement preparation process and may vary based on specific circumstances and regulatory requirements.",

Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an \\naudit conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan will always detect a \\nmaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered \\nmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic \\ndecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.  \\n\\nAs part of our audit in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in Japan, we exercise \\nprofessional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also: \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nIdentify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether \\ndue to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit \\nevidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a \\nmaterial misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may \\ninvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal \\ncontrol.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures \\n\\nthat are appropriate in the circumstances, while the objective of the audit is not to express an opinion \\non the effectiveness of the Group\u2019s internal control.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting \\nestimates and related disclosures made by management.  \\n\\n\\uf09e  Conclude on the appropriateness of management\u2019s use of the going concern basis of accounting and \\nbased on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or \\nconditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. If we \\nconclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor\u2019s report to \\nthe related disclosures in the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to \\nmodify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our \\nauditor\u2019s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a \\ngoing concern.  \\n\\n\\uf09e \\n\\nEvaluate whether the presentation and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements are in \\naccordance with accounting standards generally accepted in Japan, the overall presentation, structure \\nand content of the consolidated financial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the \\nconsolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that \\nachieves fair presentation. \\n\\n\\uf09e  Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or \\n\\nbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We \\nare responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely \\nresponsible for our audit opinion.  \\n\\nWe communicate with the Audit Committee regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing \\nof the audit, significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we \\nidentify during our audit.  \\n\\nWe also provide the Audit Committee with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical \\nrequirements regarding independence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that \\nmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards. \\n\\nFrom the matters communicated with the Audit Committee, we determine those matters that were of most \\nsignificance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements of the current period and are therefore the \\nkey audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor\u2019s report unless law or regulation precludes \\npublic disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter \\nshould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably \\nbe expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cConvenience Translation \\n\\nThe U.S. dollar amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements with respect to the year \\nended March 31, 2023 are presented solely for convenience. Our audit also included the translation of yen \\namounts into U.S. dollar amounts and, in our opinion, such translation has been made on the basis \\ndescribed in basis of presentation in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. \\n\\nInterest required to be disclosed by the Certified Public Accountants Act of Japan  \\n\\nWe do not have any interest in the Group which is required to be disclosed pursuant to the provisions of the \\nCertified Public Accountants Act of Japan. \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c/S/ Toshihiro Otsuka \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Kazuhide Niki \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\n/S/ Bumbee Nishi \\nDesignated Engagement Partner \\nCertified Public Accountant \\n\\nKPMG AZSA LLC \\nTokyo Office, Japan \\nJune 21, 2023   \\n\\nNotes to the Reader of Independent Auditor\u2019s Report:   \\nThis is a copy of the Independent Auditor\u2019s Report and the original copies are kept separately by the \\nCompany and KPMG AZSA LLC.', 'Amounts  less  than  \u00a51  million  have been  rounded  down.
