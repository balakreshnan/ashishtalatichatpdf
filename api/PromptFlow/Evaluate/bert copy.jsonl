Unlike recent language repre-\nsentation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Rad-\nford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-\ntrain deep bidirectional representations from\nunlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both\nleft and right context in all layers. As a re-\nsult, the pre-trained BERT model can be \ufb01ne-\ntuned with just one additional output layer\nto create state-of-the-art models for a wide\nrange of tasks, such as question answering and\nlanguage inference, without substantial task-\nspeci\ufb01c architecture modi\ufb01cations.\n\nBERT is conceptually simple and empirically\npowerful.\nIt obtains new state-of-the-art re-\nsults on eleven natural language processing\ntasks, including pushing the GLUE score to\n80.5% (7.7% point absolute improvement),\nMultiNLI accuracy to 86.7% (4.6% absolute\nimprovement), SQuAD v1.1 question answer-\ning Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute im-\nprovement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1\n(5.1 point absolute improvement).\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nLanguage model pre-training has been shown to\nbe effective for improving many natural language\nprocessing tasks (Dai and Le, 2015; Peters et al.,\n2018a; Radford et al., 2018; Howard and Ruder,\n2018). These include sentence-level tasks such as\nnatural language inference (Bowman et al., 2015;\nWilliams et al., 2018) and paraphrasing (Dolan\nand Brockett, 2005), which aim to predict the re-\nlationships between sentences by analyzing them\nholistically, as well as token-level tasks such as\nnamed entity recognition and question answering,\nwhere models are required to produce \ufb01ne-grained\noutput at the token level (Tjong Kim Sang and\nDe Meulder, 2003; Rajpurkar et al., 2016).\n\nThere are two existing strategies for apply-\ning pre-trained language representations to down-\nstream tasks: feature-based and \ufb01ne-tuning. The\nfeature-based approach, such as ELMo (Peters\net al., 2018a), uses task-speci\ufb01c architectures that\ninclude the pre-trained representations as addi-\ntional features. The \ufb01ne-tuning approach, such as\nthe Generative Pre-trained Transformer (OpenAI\nGPT) (Radford et al., 2018), introduces minimal\ntask-speci\ufb01c parameters, and is trained on the\ndownstream tasks by simply \ufb01ne-tuning all pre-\ntrained parameters. The two approaches share the\nsame objective function during pre-training, where\nthey use unidirectional language models to learn\ngeneral language representations.\n\nWe argue that current techniques restrict the\npower of the pre-trained representations, espe-\ncially for the \ufb01ne-tuning approaches. The ma-\njor limitation is that standard language models are\nunidirectional, and this limits the choice of archi-\ntectures that can be used during pre-training. For\nexample, in OpenAI GPT, the authors use a left-to-\nright architecture, where every token can only at-\ntend to previous tokens in the self-attention layers\nof the Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017). Such re-\nstrictions are sub-optimal for sentence-level tasks,\nand could be very harmful when applying \ufb01ne-\ntuning based approaches to token-level tasks such\nas question answering, where it is crucial to incor-\nporate context from both directions.\n\nIn this paper, we improve the \ufb01ne-tuning based\napproaches by proposing BERT: Bidirectional\nEncoder Representations\nfrom Transformers.\nBERT alleviates the previously mentioned unidi-\nrectionality constraint by using a \u201cmasked lan-\nguage model\u201d (MLM) pre-training objective, in-\nspired by the Cloze task (Taylor, 1953). The\nmasked language model randomly masks some of\nthe tokens from the input, and the objective is to\npredict the original vocabulary id of the masked\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fword based only on its context. Unlike left-to-\nright language model pre-training, the MLM ob-\njective enables the representation to fuse the left\nand the right context, which allows us to pre-\nIn addi-\ntrain a deep bidirectional Transformer.\ntion to the masked language model, we also use\na \u201cnext sentence prediction\u201d task that jointly pre-\ntrains text-pair representations. The contributions\nof our paper are as follows:\n\n\u2022 We demonstrate the importance of bidirectional\npre-training for language representations. Un-\nlike Radford et al. (2018), which uses unidirec-\ntional language models for pre-training, BERT\nuses masked language models to enable pre-\ntrained deep bidirectional representations. This\nis also in contrast to Peters et al. (2018a), which\nuses a shallow concatenation of independently\ntrained left-to-right and right-to-left LMs.\n\n\u2022 We show that pre-trained representations reduce\nthe need for many heavily-engineered task-\nspeci\ufb01c architectures. BERT is the \ufb01rst \ufb01ne-\ntuning based representation model that achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on a large suite\nof sentence-level and token-level tasks, outper-\nforming many task-speci\ufb01c architectures.\n\n\u2022 BERT advances the state of the art for eleven\nNLP tasks. The code and pre-trained mod-\nels are available at https://github.com/\ngoogle-research/bert.\n\n2 Related Work\n\nThere is a long history of pre-training general lan-\nguage representations, and we brie\ufb02y review the\nmost widely-used approaches in this section.\n\n2.1 Unsupervised Feature-based Approaches\n\nLearning widely applicable representations of\nwords has been an active area of research for\ndecades, including non-neural (Brown et al., 1992;\nAndo and Zhang, 2005; Blitzer et al., 2006) and\nneural (Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al.,\n2014) methods.\nPre-trained word embeddings\nare an integral part of modern NLP systems, of-\nfering signi\ufb01cant improvements over embeddings\nlearned from scratch (Turian et al., 2010). To pre-\ntrain word embedding vectors, left-to-right lan-\nguage modeling objectives have been used (Mnih\nand Hinton, 2009), as well as objectives to dis-\ncriminate correct from incorrect words in left and\nright context (Mikolov et al., 2013).\n\nThese approaches have been generalized to\ncoarser granularities, such as sentence embed-\ndings (Kiros et al., 2015; Logeswaran and Lee,\n2018) or paragraph embeddings (Le and Mikolov,\n2014). To train sentence representations, prior\nwork has used objectives to rank candidate next\nsentences (Jernite et al., 2017; Logeswaran and\nLee, 2018), left-to-right generation of next sen-\ntence words given a representation of the previous\nsentence (Kiros et al., 2015), or denoising auto-\nencoder derived objectives (Hill et al., 2016).\n\nELMo and its predecessor (Peters et al., 2017,\n2018a) generalize traditional word embedding re-\nsearch along a different dimension. They extract\ncontext-sensitive features from a left-to-right and a\nright-to-left language model. The contextual rep-\nresentation of each token is the concatenation of\nthe left-to-right and right-to-left representations.\nWhen integrating contextual word embeddings\nwith existing task-speci\ufb01c architectures, ELMo\nadvances the state of the art for several major NLP\nbenchmarks (Peters et al., 2018a) including ques-\ntion answering (Rajpurkar et al., 2016), sentiment\nanalysis (Socher et al., 2013), and named entity\nrecognition (Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder,\n2003). Melamud et al. (2016) proposed learning\ncontextual representations through a task to pre-\ndict a single word from both left and right context\nusing LSTMs. Similar to ELMo, their model is\nfeature-based and not deeply bidirectional. Fedus\net al. (2018) shows that the cloze task can be used\nto improve the robustness of text generation mod-\nels.\n\n2.2 Unsupervised Fine-tuning Approaches\n\nAs with the feature-based approaches, the \ufb01rst\nworks in this direction only pre-trained word em-\n(Col-\nbedding parameters from unlabeled text\nlobert and Weston, 2008).','Hector J Levesque, Ernest Davis, and Leora Morgen-\nstern. 2011.
